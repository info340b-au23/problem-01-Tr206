    <p>
        The main character in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kung_Fu_Panda">Kung Fu Panda</a> is Po who is appointed as the dragon 
        warriror through an odd number of circumstances. Initally he doesn't believe he can't live up to his title as dragon warrior, 
        but throughout the movie he slowly gain confidence and power throught the understanding that potential and power comes from within.
